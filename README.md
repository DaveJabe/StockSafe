# StockSafe
>The cutting-edge, effortless solution for tracking cases of perishable products. StockSafe's unique approach to product management makes cost-efficacy, guest-safety and employee productivity remarkably simple.

## Development Guidelines
* The Email/Password combination for logging into StockSafe on test devices/simulators is: dj96202013@gmail.com/Dj1999dj.
* The fonts used throughout this project include "Avenir" and "Avenir Heavy."
* Currently, this project lacks commented code almost entirely- now that we're working as a team, we aim to change this by commenting as throughly and parsimoniously as possible from here on out.
* Quality assurance is to be handled by the developer who has not committed the code (i.e. If David commits changes to the code, Jose reviews them for quality assurance).
* Quality assurance must be completed for ALL kanbans.
* If we fail to find aggreement on some aspect of the project's code (readability, efficiency etc.), we'll consult StackOverflow, Apple Documentation, Angela Yu's Udemy videos, Harsh and/or Faiz for guidance.
* The timeline (found below this section) will be updated weekly with 2-4 broadly defined tasks.
* Each of the four tasks will reflect a group of kanbans.
* Any kanbans that do not relate directly to the tasks of the week on the timeline should be titled "Misc."
* The overarching objective is to be in the process of submitting StockSafe to the app store 10 weeks from the date of this repository's creation (9/13/2021).
* Let's do this thing.
